## Introduction of Software

In order to provide convenience for users to design and verify the multi-core mixed task allocation algorithm, we developed a visual multi-core mixed real-time task scheduling simulator *RT-MCSS* based on C++ language. It is developed using the QT library.

## Functional Feature

+ Real-time task user-defined input
+ Simulation of mixed real-time task set scheduling (fixed-point task and sporadic task) 
+ Supports fixed-priority preemptive scheduling
+ Supports multi-core partition scheduling
+ processor state statistics
+ Timing detection such as deadline, period, etc.
+ Deadline miss ratio statistics
+ Schedulability feedback
+ And more...

## Development Environment
+ IDE: QtCreator
+ QT version：QT 5.6.1
+ Complier：Mingw49-32
